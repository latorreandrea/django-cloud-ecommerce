                At <span class="fw-bold">BluntTee</span>, we take your privacy as seriously as we take our sarcasm.

                Here’s the blunt truth: the only reason we collect your data is to make sure your awesome t-shirt finds its way to your doorstep (and not your neighbor’s).

                <li class="list-group-item bg-light">We collect only what we need: your name, address, email, and payment info (no embarrassing secrets, promise).</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-light">Your data is used exclusively to process and ship your order. No spam, no nonsense, no selling your info to shady third parties.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-light">We don’t share your data with anyone—unless you count our delivery guy, and he’s sworn to secrecy.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-light">We protect your info with the same passion we protect our best punchlines.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-light">You can request to see, change, or delete your data anytime. Just email us at <a href="mailto:info@blunttee.com">info@blunttee.com</a> (bonus points for funny subject lines).</li>
