                    <p class="card-text">Welcome to the thrilling saga of how your precious t-shirt embarks on its international journey! Spoiler alert: it's less "Fast & Furious" and more "Slow & Occasionally Curious."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Meet Asendia: The Middle Child of Shipping Companies</h3>
                    <p>Born in 2012 from the beautiful union of French La Poste and Swiss Post (yes, a shipping company love story - try not to cry), Asendia is like that friend who knows a guy who knows a guy. They don't actually own trucks or planes or anything useful like that - they just know people who do!</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike DHL, UPS, or other shipping companies that have, you know, <em>their own vehicles</em>, Asendia prefers the "pass the parcel" approach to global delivery. It's like a worldwide game of hot potato, but with your new t-shirt!</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Journey of Your BluntTee</h3>
                    <p>Here's how the magic happens:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We lovingly bundle your shirt with others (they need friends for the journey)</li>
                        <li>We send this bundle to Asendia's German logistics center (aka "The Void")</li>
                        <li>Your package spends a day being sorted, contemplating existence, and making new package friends</li>
                        <li>Eventually, your shirt gets introduced to yet ANOTHER shipping company in your country</li>
                        <li>This new company, after a sufficient period of confusion, delivers your shirt!</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p class="font-italic">Delivery times range from "surprisingly quick" to "did they send this by carrier pigeon?"</p>

                    <h2 class="card-title">Returns: Because Sometimes Relationships Just Don't Work Out</h2>
                    <p>It's not you, it's the shirt. Or maybe it is you. Either way, we get it - sometimes things don't fit, both literally and metaphorically.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How to Break Up with Your BluntTee:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Email us at info@blunttee.com with your order number RETURNS write in the object and a sob story (the sadder, the better)</li>
                        <li>We'll send you a return label faster than you can say "this shirt makes me look like a potato"</li>
                        <li>Package your unwanted item(s) - please don't cry on them, tears void the warranty</li>
                        <li>Drop off your return at any post office and wave goodbye dramatically</li>
                        <li>Once we receive your return (anywhere from 3 days to the heat death of the universe), we'll process your refund</li>
                    </ol>

                        <strong>Important Note:</strong> If you've worn the shirt while skydiving, wrestling alligators, or attending a spaghetti-eating contest, we reserve the right to question your life choices as well as deny your return.
